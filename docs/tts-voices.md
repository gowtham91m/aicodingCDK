## How to Use Different Voices

To use a different voice, simply specify the voice name in the request:

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, this is a test of the text to speech functionality.",
  "voice": "en-US-Neural2-F"
}
```

Or with SSML:

```json
{
  "ssml": "<speak>Hello, this is a test of the <sub alias=\"text to speech\">TTS</sub> functionality with <emphasis>SSML</emphasis> support.</speak>",
  "voice": "en-US-Neural2-F"
}
```

## Voice Selection Tips

1. **Quality vs. Cost**: Neural2 and Studio voices provide the highest quality but may cost more. Standard voices are more economical for large-scale applications.

2. **Gender and Tone**: Choose a voice that matches your application's persona or brand.

3. **Language and Accent**: Select a voice that matches your target audience's language and regional accent.

4. **Testing**: Test different voices to find the one that best suits your application's needs.
